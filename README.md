# Kaggle-Dont-Overfit
In the following machine learning project the objective was to predict the output given 300 continuous variables and 250 training examples only without overfitting on the data.

This repository contains two versions with two different approaches.

1. In the first one I have used a GaussianNB model.(Score obtained is 0.505)

2.In the second one I have used a XGBoost Classifier model.(Score obtained is 0.510)

My Kaggle username is "sidagar" without quotes.
